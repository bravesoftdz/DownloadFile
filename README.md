# DownloadFile
allow you to download a file with several parameters :
- url
- guid
- extension of the file
for example :
DowloadFile.exe "http://localhost:8080/download" "1234-567-8910" "jpg"
Imagine that , on a server , a directory named "1234-567-8910" contains only one picture file "sun.jpg" ; the application downloads "sun.jpg".
